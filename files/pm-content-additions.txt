# Agile & Scrum for Product Managers

## What is Agile?

A philosophy of software development that values:
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Scrum Framework

**Scrum** is the most popular Agile methodology.

### The Scrum Team

**Product Owner (That's You!)**
- Defines the vision
- Prioritizes backlog
- Accepts/rejects work

**Scrum Master**
- Facilitates ceremonies
- Removes blockers
- Coaches team on Agile

**Development Team**
- Engineers, designers, QA
- Self-organizing
- Cross-functional

### Scrum Artifacts

**1. Product Backlog**
- Prioritized list of all work
- Owned by PM
- Continuously refined

**2. Sprint Backlog**
- Work committed for current sprint
- Team owns execution

**3. Increment**
- Potentially shippable product at end of sprint

### Scrum Ceremonies

**Sprint Planning** (2-4 hours)
- What can we deliver this sprint?
- How will we do it?
- PM presents prioritized backlog
- Team commits to sprint goal

**Daily Standup** (15 min)
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Any blockers?
- PM attends but doesn't run it

**Sprint Review/Demo** (1-2 hours)
- Demo what was built
- Get stakeholder feedback
- PM decides: ship or iterate?

**Sprint Retrospective** (1 hour)
- What went well?
- What could improve?
- Action items for next sprint
- Team-only (PM usually not present)

**Backlog Refinement** (Ongoing)
- Break down stories
- Add details
- Estimate effort
- PM leads this

## PM's Role in Agile

### Before Sprint
- Prioritize backlog
- Write user stories
- Define acceptance criteria
- Ensure stories are "ready"

### During Sprint
- Answer questions
- Unblock team
- Manage stakeholders
- Prepare for demo

### After Sprint
- Review work
- Gather feedback
- Update roadmap
- Plan next sprint

## Writing Good User Stories

**Format**:
As a [user type]
I want [feature]
So that [benefit]

**Example**:
As a driver
I want to see passenger ratings before accepting
So that I can avoid problematic riders

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Rating displayed on ride request screen
- Shows average rating + number of trips
- Can decline without penalty if rating < 4.5

## Definition of Ready (DoR)

Story is ready for sprint when:
- [ ] User story is clear
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Designs attached (if needed)
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Estimated by team
- [ ] Prioritized by PM

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Work is done when:
- [ ] Code written & reviewed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Designs match
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] PM has accepted
- [ ] Deployed to staging/production

## Sprint Velocity

**Velocity** = Amount of work completed per sprint

Track over time:
- Sprint 1: 21 points
- Sprint 2: 18 points
- Sprint 3: 24 points
- **Average**: ~21 points/sprint

Use for forecasting:
- Feature X = 42 points
- At 21 points/sprint
- **Estimate**: 2 sprints

## Handling Common Challenges

**Challenge**: Engineers want to spend full sprint on tech debt
**Solution**: Allocate 20% capacity for tech debt/improvements

**Challenge**: Stakeholder wants mid-sprint change
**Solution**: Add to backlog for next sprint (unless critical bug)

**Challenge**: Team consistently misses commitments
**Solution**: Reduce sprint scope, improve estimation, address blockers

**Challenge**: Design isn't ready when sprint starts
**Solution**: Design 1-2 sprints ahead

## Kanban vs Scrum

**Scrum**:
- Fixed sprint length (2 weeks)
- Work in batches
- Regular releases

**Kanban**:
- Continuous flow
- Work-in-progress limits
- Release anytime

**When to use Kanban**:
- Support/maintenance mode
- Unpredictable work (bugs, requests)
- Mature product with continuous deployment

**When to use Scrum**:
- New product development
- Need regular planning cadence
- Large features requiring coordination

      keyTakeaways: [
        "Agile = iterative development with continuous feedback",
        "PM owns the 'what' (backlog), team owns the 'how' (execution)",
        "Sprint planning, standup, review, retro are core ceremonies"
      ],

# Feature Prioritization

## Why Prioritization Matters

You have 100 ideas. You can only build 10. Prioritization = your superpower.

## RICE Framework

**Most popular PM prioritization framework**

### R = Reach
How many users affected per time period?
- New onboarding flow: 1000 users/month
- Power user feature: 50 users/month

### I = Impact  
How much does it move the needle?
- 0.25 = Minimal
- 0.5 = Low
- 1 = Medium
- 2 = High
- 3 = Massive

### C = Confidence
How sure are you?
- 100% = Have data
- 80% = Strong hypothesis
- 50% = Educated guess
- 20% = Wild guess (don't build)

### E = Effort
Person-months of work
- 0.5 = Few days
- 1 = One person-month
- 2 = Two person-months
- 5+ = Quarter+ of work

**RICE Score = (R × I × C) / E**

### Example:

**Feature A**: Improved onboarding
- Reach: 2000 users/month
- Impact: 2 (high - drives activation)
- Confidence: 80%
- Effort: 2 person-months
- **RICE = (2000 × 2 × 0.8) / 2 = 1600**

**Feature B**: Dark mode
- Reach: 5000 users/month
- Impact: 0.5 (nice-to-have)
- Confidence: 100%
- Effort: 1 person-month
- **RICE = (5000 × 0.5 × 1.0) / 1 = 2500**

**Winner**: Dark mode (higher RICE)

## Other Frameworks

### Value vs Effort (2x2 Matrix)

```
High Value  | Quick Win  | Big Bet
           |            |
           |------------|
           |            |
Low Value   | Fill-In    | Time Sink
           
           Low Effort  High Effort
```

**Priority**:
1. Quick wins
2. Big bets
3. Fill-ins
4. Avoid time sinks

### MoSCoW

- **Must have**: Non-negotiable
- **Should have**: Important but not critical
- **Could have**: Nice-to-have
- **Won't have**: Not doing this time

### ICE Score

- **Impact**: How much value?
- **Confidence**: How sure?
- **Ease**: How easy to build?

**ICE Score = (I + C + E) / 3**

Simpler than RICE but less nuanced.

### Kano Model

Features fall into categories:

**1. Basic Needs** (table stakes)
- If missing: users are dissatisfied
- If present: users are neutral
- Example: App doesn't crash

**2. Performance Needs** (more is better)
- More = more satisfaction
- Example: Faster loading

**3. Delighters** (unexpected joy)
- Not expected, but users love it
- Example: Spotify Wrapped

**Strategy**:
- Fix all basic needs first
- Improve performance needs strategically
- Add delighters when you can

## Prioritization Principles

### 1. Align with Strategy
Does this move us toward our vision?

### 2. Maximize Value/Effort Ratio
Quick wins build momentum

### 3. Consider Dependencies
Feature B requires Feature A? Do A first.

### 4. Balance Short-term vs Long-term
Don't ignore tech debt while chasing features

### 5. Listen to Data, Not HiPPO
(Highest Paid Person's Opinion)

### 6. Say No to Good Ideas
"Good" ideas distract from "great" ones

## The Prioritization Process

**Step 1**: List all ideas
- Backlog of 50+ items

**Step 2**: Quickly eliminate obvious nos
- Out of strategy
- Too large
- Not solving real problem

**Step 3**: Score remaining items (RICE)
- Be honest about scores
- Get input from team

**Step 4**: Rank by score
- Top 10 candidates

**Step 5**: Check for balance
- All features for power users? Adjust.
- All quick wins, no strategic bets? Adjust.

**Step 6**: Get team buy-in
- Share rationale
- Explain tradeoffs

**Step 7**: Commit to top 3-5
- For next quarter
- Revisit quarterly

## When Stakeholders Push Back

**Scenario**: "We NEED feature X for this big customer deal"

**Response**: 
1. Validate: Is this feature actually blocking the deal?
2. Generalize: Would this feature help other customers too?
3. Assess effort: Can we do a simple version?
4. Trade-off: What would we NOT do if we do this?
5. Decide using framework (not just loudest voice)

**Phrases**:
- "Help me understand the impact. How many customers need this?"
- "If we do this, we can't do Y. Which is more important?"
- "Can we test this assumption with the customer first?"

## Real Example: Spotify's Prioritization

**2016 Problem**: What to prioritize?
- Family plan
- Student discount
- Podcasts
- Lyrics
- Video

**How they decided**:

**Family Plan**:
- Reach: 50M potential subscribers
- Impact: 3 (major revenue driver)
- Confidence: 80% (tested in select markets)
- Effort: 3 months
- **RICE: High**
- ✅ Built in Q2 2016

**Video**:
- Reach: All users
- Impact: 1.5 (engagement increase unclear)
- Confidence: 30% (unproven)
- Effort: 6 months
- **RICE: Low**
- ❌ Deprioritized (later shut down)

**Result**: Family plan became huge revenue driver. Video was canceled.

## Exercise

Take your product backlog:
1. List your top 10 feature ideas
2. Score each with RICE
3. Rank by score
4. What surprised you?
5. What would you cut?
      `,
      keyTakeaways: [
        "RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort",
        "Good ideas are the enemy of great ideas - say no often",
        "Use frameworks to make objective decisions, not politics"
      ],
      framework: "RICE, Value vs Effort, MoSCoW, ICE, Kano Model",
      tools: ["ProductBoard", "Aha!", "Spreadsheets"],
      nextSteps: "Score your backlog using RICE framework"
    },

# Influence Without Authority

## The PM's Dilemma

You're responsible for the product's success, but you don't manage anyone:
- You can't tell Engineering what to build
- You can't tell Design what to design
- You can't tell Sales what to sell

**You must influence, not command.**

## The 5 Sources of Influence

### 1. Expertise
Be the expert on:
- User needs
- Market dynamics
- Product vision
- Data/metrics

**How to build it**: Do the research no one else has time for

### 2. Relationships
Build trust before you need it
- Lunch with engineers
- Help others when they ask
- Remember personal details
- Be reliable

### 3. Data
Numbers don't lie
- User metrics
- Customer feedback
- A/B test results
- Market research

### 4. Story
Paint a picture people want to be part of
- Where are we going?
- Why does it matter?
- What role do they play?

### 5. Facilitation
Make others look good
- Give credit generously
- Highlight their work
- Ask for their input
- Make them the hero

## Influencing Different Stakeholders

### Engineering
**What they care about**:
- Technical excellence
- No stupid requirements
- Interesting problems
- Work-life balance

**How to influence**:
- Write clear specs
- Understand technical constraints
- Protect them from scope creep
- Celebrate technical wins

**Don't**:
- Commit to dates without them
- Change requirements mid-sprint
- Throw specs over the wall
- Blame them when things go wrong

### Design
**What they care about**:
- User experience
- Design quality
- Creative freedom
- Impact

**How to influence**:
- Involve early (not after specs are done)
- Share user research
- Give context, not solutions
- Trust their expertise

**Don't**:
- Dictate the design
- Skip research
- Rush the process
- Overrule without data

### Sales
**What they care about**:
- Closing deals
- Commission
- Customer promises
- Competitive wins

**How to influence**:
- Enable them (demos, collateral)
- Understand their challenges
- Deliver on commitments
- Give them wins

**Don't**:
- Promise features with no timeline
- Blame them for revenue misses
- Ignore their customer feedback
- Launch without warning

### Marketing
**What they care about**:
- Launches
- Messaging
- Lead generation
- Brand

**How to influence**:
- Loop them in early
- Give them compelling story
- Support their campaigns
- Share user insights

**Don't**:
- Surprise launch them
- Ignore positioning
- Build features no one cares about
- Skip the go-to-market plan

### Executives
**What they care about**:
- Revenue/growth
- Strategy execution
- Competitive position
- Risk management

**How to influence**:
- Show business impact
- Be concise (execs are busy)
- Know your numbers
- Recommend, don't just present problems

**Don't**:
- Bring problems without solutions
- Ramble
- Ignore the business model
- Surprise them with bad news

## The Influence Toolkit

### 1. Start with Why
"Here's what we're seeing from users..."
"The data shows..."
"Our strategy is to..."
Then: "So I'm thinking we should..."

### 2. Make it Their Idea
Ask questions that lead them to your conclusion:
- "What if we tried..."
- "What would happen if..."
- "How might we..."

### 3. Build Coalition
Get key people on board before the big meeting
- 1:1 conversations
- "Can I run something by you?"
- Address concerns privately

### 4. Use Pilot Programs
Instead of: "We should completely redesign the app"
Try: "What if we test this with 5% of users first?"

### 5. Frame as Experiment
"Let's run a 2-week experiment and see what we learn"
Lower commitment = easier yes

### 6. Speak Their Language
- To engineers: "This reduces technical debt"
- To sales: "This closes 3 pending deals"
- To executives: "This moves our North Star metric"

## Dealing with Conflict

### Scenario 1: Engineering says "This will take 6 months"
You think it should take 1 month.

❌ Bad: "That's ridiculous, it's simple!"

✅ Good: 
"Help me understand the complexity. What's driving the timeline?"
Then: "What if we cut scope to X? Could we ship in 2 months?"

### Scenario 2: Sales wants a custom feature for one customer
But it's off-strategy.

❌ Bad: "No, we're not building that."

✅ Good:
"I understand this deal is important. Let's look at the data:
- How many other customers need this?
- What's the revenue impact?
- What would we NOT build if we do this?
Based on that, here's my recommendation..."

### Scenario 3: Design disagrees with your direction

❌ Bad: "Just design what I asked for."

✅ Good:
"I hear your concerns. Can you show me what you're thinking?
Maybe there's a better way I'm not seeing.
The problem we're trying to solve is X - how would you approach it?"

## Building Long-term Influence

### 1. Be Right (Often)
Your ideas should generally work out
- Do your homework
- Validate before building
- Follow up on results

### 2. Be Honest
If you made a mistake, admit it
"I was wrong about X. Here's what I learned."

### 3. Be Helpful
Help others succeed
- Unblock people
- Share insights
- Make intros

### 4. Be Reliable
Do what you say you'll do
- Meet deadlines
- Follow through
- Respond promptly

### 5. Be Humble
You don't know everything
- Ask for input
- Listen to feedback
- Give credit

## Red Flags You're Doing It Wrong

🚩 People avoid your meetings
🚩 No one responds to your Slack messages
🚩 Your ideas get shot down regularly
🚩 You hear "that's not in my scope"
🚩 People route around you

**Fix**:
- Ask for feedback: "How can I be more effective?"
- Rebuild relationships
- Deliver some wins
- Change your approach

## Real Example: Airbnb's Photography Initiative

**Context**: 
Listings had terrible photos. Bookings were suffering.

**Problem**: 
How do you get hosts to improve photos without mandating it?

**Bad Approach**:
"All hosts must use professional photographers"
→ Hosts would rebel, too expensive, not scalable

**Good Approach** (what they actually did):
1. Ran experiment: Offered free photography in SF
2. Showed data: 2-3x more bookings with pro photos
3. Made it optional but promoted it
4. Let hosts see their neighbors' success
5. Eventually 13,000 freelance photographers in network

**Result**: Hosts wanted it because they saw the value, not because they were forced.

**Lesson**: Influence through:
- Data (2-3x more bookings)
- Social proof (neighbors succeeding)
- Making it easy (free, optional)
- Letting people choose
      `,
      keyTakeaways: [
        "Influence through expertise, relationships, data, story, and facilitation",
        "Understand what each stakeholder cares about, speak their language",
        "Build coalition before the big meeting - no surprises"

===== ADD TO METRICS LESSONS =====

"KPIs & OKRs": {
      content: `
# KPIs & OKRs for Product Managers

## KPIs vs OKRs

### KPI (Key Performance Indicator)
**What**: Health metrics you track continuously
**Purpose**: Monitor business health
**Example**: Monthly Active Users, Churn Rate, NPS

### OKR (Objectives & Key Results)
**What**: Ambitious goals for a specific time period
**Purpose**: Drive change and focus
**Example**: 
- Objective: Become the #1 collaboration tool for remote teams
- Key Result 1: Increase team adoption from 10% → 30%
- Key Result 2: Achieve 4.5+ G2 rating
- Key Result 3: $10M ARR from enterprise

## North Star Metric

The ONE metric that best captures core value you deliver to customers.

**Examples**:
- Airbnb: Nights booked
- Facebook: Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Slack: Messages sent
- Spotify: Time spent listening
- Uber: Rides per week

**Good North Star characteristics**:
✅ Measures value to customer
✅ Leads to revenue (directly or indirectly)
✅ Actionable (team can move it)
✅ Understandable (everyone gets it)

## AARRR Pirate Metrics

**A**cquisition: Users discover you
**A**ctivation: Users have good first experience
**R**etention: Users come back
**R**evenue: Users pay
**R**eferral: Users tell others

Example: SaaS Product

**Acquisition**: 10,000 signups/month
**Activation**: 40% complete onboarding
**Retention**: 60% return Week 2
**Revenue**: 5% convert to paid
**Referral**: 15% invite teammates

## Setting Good OKRs

### O = Objective (the "What")
**Qualitative, inspirational, time-bound**

❌ Bad: "Improve metrics"
✅ Good: "Become the go-to platform for freelance designers"

❌ Bad: "Make more money"
✅ Good: "Achieve sustainable unit economics"

### KR = Key Results (the "How")
**Quantitative, measurable, achievable but ambitious**

For Objective: "Become the go-to platform for freelance designers"

KR1: Increase Monthly Active Designers from 50K → 150K
KR2: Achieve 50% of designers earning $1K+/month (up from 20%)
KR3: Reach 4.8/5 app store rating

## OKR Cadence

**Annual OKRs**: Company-wide strategy
**Quarterly OKRs**: Team/product focus
**Monthly Check-ins**: Progress review

## Scoring OKRs

**0.0 - 0.3**: Missed - major issues
**0.4 - 0.6**: Made progress but fell short
**0.7 - 1.0**: Hit or exceeded

**Note**: Consistently hitting 1.0 = goals aren't ambitious enough!

## Common Metrics by Product Stage

### Early Stage (Finding PMF)
- Retention cohorts (Week 1, Week 4)
- Core action completion rate
- Qualitative feedback (NPS, interviews)
- "Aha moment" activation rate

### Growth Stage
- User acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Viral coefficient (K-factor)
- Activation rate
- Retention rate

### Maturity Stage
- Revenue per user
- Churn rate
- Net revenue retention
- Customer satisfaction (NPS/CSAT)
- Market share

## Choosing the Right Metrics

**Vanity Metrics** (look good but don't matter):
❌ Total registered users (if most are inactive)
❌ Page views (if no engagement)
❌ App downloads (if not used)

**Actionable Metrics** (you can actually improve):
✅ Weekly Active Users / Monthly Active Users (WAU/MAU)
✅ % users completing core action
✅ Time to value
✅ Retention curves

## Red Flags in Metrics

🚩 **Metric Gaming**
Example: PM bonused on signups → team buys fake accounts

🚩 **Metric Tunnel Vision**
Focusing on one metric ignores others
Example: Optimize for growth → ignore retention → users churn

🚩 **Lagging Indicators Only**
Only tracking outputs (revenue) not inputs (user engagement)

🚩 **Too Many Metrics**
Tracking 50 things = tracking nothing
Pick 5-7 key metrics

## Real Example: Superhuman's OKR

**Context**: Superhuman in 2019

**Objective**: Achieve strong product-market fit

**Key Results**:
- KR1: 40%+ of users say they'd be "very disappointed" without Superhuman
- KR2: Reduce median time to inbox zero from 60 min → 15 min
- KR3: 4.5+ NPS among active users

**How they tracked**:
- Quarterly user surveys
- In-app analytics
- Customer interviews

**Result**: Hit 58% "very disappointed" (exceeded 40% goal)

**What happened next**:
This validated PMF. They then focused OKRs on growth and retention.

## Exercise

For your product:
1. What's your North Star Metric?
2. Map your AARRR funnel with real numbers
3. Write one Quarterly OKR with 3 Key Results
4. How will you measure success?
      `,
      keyTakeaways: [
        "North Star Metric = ONE metric that captures core value",
        "OKRs should be ambitious (hitting 1.0 every time = not ambitious enough)",
        "Focus on actionable metrics, not vanity metrics"

===== ADD TO TECHNICAL LESSONS =====

"API Basics": {
      content: `
# API Basics for Product Managers

## What is an API?

**API = Application Programming Interface**

Think of it as a waiter at a restaurant:
- You (app) tell waiter (API) what you want
- Waiter takes order to kitchen (server)
- Kitchen prepares food (data)
- Waiter brings food back to you

## Why PMs Need to Understand APIs

1. **Build better products**: Understand technical constraints
2. **Talk to engineers**: Speak their language
3. **Evaluate integrations**: What's possible?
4. **Scope features**: Know what's hard vs easy

## REST APIs (Most Common)

### HTTP Methods:
- **GET**: Retrieve data
  - `GET /users/123` → Get user 123's info
- **POST**: Create new data
  - `POST /users` → Create new user
- **PUT**: Update data
  - `PUT /users/123` → Update user 123
- **DELETE**: Delete data
  - `DELETE /users/123` → Delete user 123

### Example: Spotify API

Get a playlist:
```
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
```

Response:
```json
{
  "name": "Today's Top Hits",
  "tracks": [
    {
      "title": "Song Name",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "duration": 180000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common API Concepts

### 1. Endpoints
URLs where you can access different resources
- `/users` → User list
- `/users/123` → Specific user
- `/users/123/posts` → User's posts

### 2. Authentication
How API knows who you are
- **API Keys**: Simple token
- **OAuth**: Secure login (like "Sign in with Google")

### 3. Rate Limiting
How many requests allowed per time period
- "100 requests per hour"
- Prevents abuse

### 4. Webhooks
API calls YOU when something happens
- Example: Stripe webhook when payment succeeds
- Instead of constantly checking, they notify you

### 5. Status Codes
- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad request (your fault)
- **401**: Unauthorized (need login)
- **404**: Not found
- **500**: Server error (their fault)

## SDK vs API

**API**: Raw interface (more flexible, more work)
**SDK**: Pre-built code library (easier, less flexible)

Example:
- Stripe API: Make HTTP requests manually
- Stripe SDK: `stripe.charges.create()` - much easier

## Real-World PM Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Integrating with Another Service

**Request**: "Can we integrate with Salesforce?"

**PM should ask**:
- Do they have a public API?
- What data can we access?
- What are the rate limits?
- Do we need OAuth?
- Is there an SDK?

### Scenario 2: Building an API

**Request**: "We want to let other apps integrate with us"

**PM should decide**:
- What data to expose?
- How to authenticate?
- What rate limits?
- How to version it? (v1, v2)
- Documentation strategy

### Scenario 3: Third-Party API Goes Down

**Problem**: Your product depends on Google Maps API, and it's down

**PM should**:
- Have backup plan (fallback provider?)
- Communicate to users
- Understand SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- Consider rate limiting our own usage

## GraphQL (Alternative to REST)

**Advantage**: Request exactly the data you need

REST (multiple requests):
```
GET /users/123
GET /users/123/posts
GET /users/123/followers
```

GraphQL (one request):
```graphql
{
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    posts { title }
    followers { name }
  }
}
```

**When to use**:
- Complex data requirements
- Mobile apps (minimize requests)
- When you need flexibility

## What PMs Don't Need to Know

❌ How to write API code
❌ Exact implementation details
❌ Database queries

✅ What's possible
✅ Rough effort level
✅ Tradeoffs between approaches

## PM-Friendly API Questions

When evaluating an integration:

1. **"Does this API give us what we need?"**
   - Check API documentation
   - Look at example responses

2. **"How reliable is it?"**
   - Uptime stats?
   - SLA?

3. **"What's the cost?"**
   - Free tier?
   - Per-request pricing?

4. **"How hard to integrate?"**
   - SDK available?
   - Good documentation?
   - Active support?

5. **"What happens if it breaks?"**
   - Can we cache data?
   - Fallback option?

## Exercise

1. Find the API documentation for a product you use (Stripe, Twilio, etc.)
